# Big Data Analystics in Tableau

This project was to use fleet data to refine and analyse trucking movement to meet the organisational goal of better understanding risk. The use case involves geographic data, vehicles, average, mileage, gas consumption, events, risk factors, other supporting information. 
Each truck has been equipped with devices to log location and event data. These events are streamed back to data centre where we can process the data and revise truck movements to increase safety.

In this Project the data is imported to Hadoop distributed system and then it has been analysed in Tableau by integrating tableau with Hadoop
